# Week 01: Linear Models

## Regression

$$
y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \cdot x_1 + \epsilon
$$

$\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$ are the regression parameters:

- $\beta_0$ is also the intercept
- $\beta_1$ ist the slope

## Coefficients

The coefficients are estimated from data. Estimated regression coefficients are denoted with a hat (e.g. $\hat{\beta_1}$). Fitted values (i.e. what the model predicts) are denoted with a hat as well (i.e. $\hat{y}$). Residuals are the difference between observed and predicted values.

$$
\text{res} = y - \hat{y}
$$
