# Week 01: Linear Models

## Regression

$$
y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \cdot x_1 + \epsilon
$$

$\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$ are the regression parameters:

- $\beta_0$ is also the intercept
- $\beta_1$ ist the slope

## Coefficients

The coefficients are estimated from data. Estimated regression coefficients are denoted with a hat (e.g. $\hat{\beta_1}$). Fitted values (i.e. what the model predicts) are denoted with a hat as well (i.e. $\hat{y}$). Residuals are the difference between observed and predicted values.

$$
\text{res} = y - \hat{y}
$$

If the errors are normally distributed, regression coefficients can be tested with t-tests

::: {.callout-caution}
Dichotomising p-values into ”significant”/”non-significant” is very bad practice!
:::

The grade of fit can be quantified with $R^2$

$$
R^2 = corr(y, \hat{y})^2
$$

> Note: $R^2$ is not used to formally compare model.

## p-values

The p-value quantifies the probability of observing the value of the test statistic, or a more extreme value, under the null hypothesis. Low p-values are coherent with a rejection of the null hypothesis stating that there is no effect. Large p-values (close to 1) do not imply the we can accept the null hypothesis.

## Testing

### Categorical Values

Categorical values can be tested via F-tests by using the `drop1()` function or by comparing two models via the `anova()` function. Comparisons among levels of a factor (i.e. ”contrasts”) can be performed by using the `glht()` function.

### Continuous or discrete variables

Continuous (and discrete) variables can be tested via F-tests (with `drop1()`) or by t-tests (with `summary()`). Sometimes the inferential results for continuous variables are best displayed and communicated with confidence intervals.

### Interactions

If an interaction term is shown to be significant, then all terms involved in this interaction play a relevant role. An interaction involving two predictors is called ”two-fold interaction” (e.g. `age * species`)

> Note: An interaction can involve more than two predictor.
