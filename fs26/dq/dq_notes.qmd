# Lecture 01: Introduction

## Relevance of Data Quality

A key advance in data quality emerged in the 1920s through R. A. Fisher’s work in experimental design, which introduced randomization and replication to estimate error, bias, and precision.

## Definitions

### Data

Data are abstract representations of selected features of real-world entities, events, and concepts, expressed and understood through clearly definable conventions (Sebastian-Coleman, 2013).

### Data Quality

- Contextual data quality: The quality of data is defined by two related factors: how well it meets the expectations of data consumers (how well it is able to serve the purposes of its intended use).
- Intrinsic data quality: How well it represents the objects, events, and concepts it is created to represent.

## Data Management

### DQ as part of Data Management

Data Governance sits at the center (the hub) because it provides oversight, direction, policies, and coordination. Data quality is but one element of effective data management.

### Role of Data Quality Managers

- Develop a governed approach to make data fit for purpose based on data consumers requirements.
- Define standards, requirements, and specifications for data quality controls as part of the data lifecycle.
- Define and implement processes to measure, monitor, and report on data quality levels.
- Identify and advocate for opportunities to improve the quality of data, through process and system improvements.

## Data Quality Dimensions

- Correctness/accuracy: The data accurately describe the entity in question
- Completeness: No missing records/field values
- Conformity/validity: Correct types, value ranges, etc.
- Consistency: No contradictions between different data sets / tables

> Note: Breaking the issue down into dimensions helps to quantify issues.

::: {.callout-note}
Most sources agree that the concept of data quality has several dimensions. But they don't agree on what these dimensions are.
