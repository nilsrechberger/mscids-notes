# Hey there, fellow students! 👋

Here you'll find a collection of my **personal notes and solutions** from our courses. I've decided to put them online in the hopes that they might help some of you out.

### Quick Heads-Up! 📝

Just a friendly reminder: everything you see here is based on my own understanding and approach. That means my solutions might be different from the official ones provided by our professors.

Think of this as a **secondary resource** to complement your own work, not as an official answer key.

### Disclaimer 🚨

While I do my best, I can't guarantee that everything is 100% correct or complete. I'm just a student trying to figure things out, same as you. Therefore, I'm not taking any responsibility for the accuracy of the content. **Always double-check with official course materials!**

### Spotted a Mistake? 👀

If you happen to find an error, I'd be super grateful if you could let me know. Just shoot me a quick email!

Happy studying! 🚀
