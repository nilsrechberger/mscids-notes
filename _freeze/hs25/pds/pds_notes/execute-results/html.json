The code is sent to the interpreter line by line. The interpreter provides a console for ad-hoc commands. It's usually slower than a compiler and not good for optimization.\n\nA compiler processes source code and returns an executable file. Compiler languages are usually fast and made for optimization (speed, storage use). Executable code is almost impossible to reverse-engineer.\n\n# Intelligent Development Environment (IDE)\n\nTypically, an IDE provides additional tools to make programming more convenient. IDEs provide tools such as:\n\n- Debuggers\n- Deployment chain control\n- File browser\n- Terminal\n- Version control interface\n- etc.\n\n> Note: Python is a text-only language that can be written in a simple text editor.\n\n## Python console vs. script\n\nThe Python console is a direct interface to the interpreter. Every instruction is sent sequentially to the interpreter. Commands sent in the console are sent directly to the interpreter.\n\nA Python script is a collection of commands. Executing a Python script means sending all the commands it contains consecutively to the interpreter.\n\n## Virtual enviroments (venv)\n\nTo avoid dependency issues of packages and keep the development environment clean, developers programme applications in virtual environments.\n\n\n```{bash}\nPython3 -m venv .venv # Standard name\n```\n\n\n> Note: It is best practice to name the virtual environment .venv to hide it in the file system.\n\nYou need to activate the virtual environment.\n\n\n```{bash}\n. .venv/bin/activate # For Linux\n```\n\n\nYou can install packages into the venv with `python3-pip`.\n\n# Python Basics\n\n## Variabels and Basic data types\n\nA variable is a name that refers to a particular or undefined value. In programming languages, we use them as a reference to a particular storage location. A variable always consists of a name, a data type, a storage location and a value. Python does not require any type for variable definitions. It assumes the type from the value.\n\n> Note: Variable names are usually written in lowercase.\n\nBasic data types:\n\n- Integer (int)\n- String (str)\n- Boolean (bool).\n- List\n- Dictionary\n\n## Mathematical Operations\n\nDepending on the context, two particular mathematical operators can have different meanings. The sum operator ($+$), except for numerical values, means appending one element to another. This usually requires two elements of the same data type. The multiplication operation ($*$) always has to be applied with an integer.\n\n> Note: Sum and multiplication can be used with strings.\n\n## Boolean operations\n\nTwo Boolean values can be combined in different ways using the keywords `and`, `or` and `xor`. Any Boolean operation can be inverted using the keyword `not`.\n\n# Sequential data types\n\nIn Python, sequential data types can comprise mixed data types and can have multiple dimensions.\n\n- List: Ordered, changeable.\n- Tuple: Ordered, unchangeable.\n- Dictonary: Key-Value-Pairs.\n- Set: No Duplicates.\n\n# Type casting\n\nDepending on the operation, the same data may have to appear in different types. Data of a particular type can be transformed into a different data type.\n\n::: {#e8288d7f .cell execution_count=1}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nx = 3\n\n# Same variable but different data type\nprint(\"x as int= \", int(x))\nprint(\"x as float= \", float(x))\nprint(\"x as string= \", str(x)) # Looks like int but is type str!\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nx as int=  3\nx as float=  3.0\nx as string=  3\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n# Input and Output\n\nInteraction with an application requires input and output. Use the `input()` function to print the passed string to the standard output (i.e., terminal). The input is read from the terminal and converted to a string.\n\n# Boolean\n\nA boolean expression can be of two states only (`True` or `False`).\n\n> Note: Python treats all that is NOT 'empty', '0', 'False' or 'None' as 'True'\n\nPriority-List:\n\n1. not\n2. and\n3. or\n\n## Bitwise operations\n\nBitwise operations in Python are used to manipulate individual bits of integer values.\n\n- `x | y` bitwise or of x and y\n- `x ^ y` bitwise exclusive or of x and y\n- `x & y` bitwise and of x and y\n- `x << n` x shifted left by n bits\n- `x >> n` x shifted right by n bits\n- `~x` the bits of x inverted\n\n## Comparison operations\n\n- `<` strictly less than\n- `<=` less than or equal\n- `>` strictly greater than\n- `>=` greater than or equal\n- `==` equal\n- `!=` not equal\n- `is` object identity\n- `is not` negated object identity\n\n> Note: Comparisons can be chained arbitrarily.\n\n# Indentation and syntax\n\nBlock operations start with a colon (:) and are defined by indentations. Indentations can have an arbitrary number of spaces but must be constant for all instructions within the same block.\n\n## Single block\n\n\n```{markdown}\ninstruction\ninstruction\nblock header:\n••••block instruction\n••••block instruction\n••••block instruction\ninstruction\ninstruction\n```\n\n\n## Nested blocks\n\n\n```{markdown}\ninstruction\ninstruction\nblock 1 header:\n••••block 1 instruction\n••••block 2 header:\n••••••••block 2 instruction\n••••••••block 2 instruction\n••••block 1 instruction\n••••block 1 instruction\ninstruction\n```\n\n\n# If-else condition\n\nThe if-else statement is a control structure for checking a condition, allowing you to execute different code blocks depending on whether the condition is met.\n\n::: {#5b205e23 .cell execution_count=2}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nx = 10\n\nif x == 10:\n    print(\"x has the value 10\")\nelse:\n    print(\"x does not have the value 10\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nx has the value 10\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Elif concatenation\n\n`elif` allows for concatenating multiple conditions.\n\n::: {#d343568a .cell execution_count=3}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nx = 6\n\nif x == 10:\n    print(\"x has the value 10\")\nelif x % 2 == 0:\n    print(\"x is an even number\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nx is an even number\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Shorthand statement\n\nShorthand `if` statements allow for less code and better readability.\n\n::: {#12990d75 .cell execution_count=4}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nx = 10\n\n# Block\nif x == 10:\n    x += 1\n    print(x)\nelse:\n    None\n\n## Is the same as\n\nx = 10\n# One Line\nx = x + 1 if x == 10 else None\nprint(x)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n11\n11\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n# Match case\n\nInstead of using multiple combined conditions with elif statements, an expression can be directly checked against multiple specific cases.\n\n::: {#63aa5f33 .cell execution_count=5}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nx = 2\nmatch x:\n    case 0:\n        print(\"number is 0\")\n    case 1:\n        print(\"number is 1\")\n    case 2:\n        print(\"number is 2\")\n    case _: # Default case\n        print(\"number unknown\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nnumber is 2\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n# Loops\n\n## range ()\n\nThe class range() allows creating sequence objects with constant step sizes.

Remote resources can be provided by individual institutions like HSLU, or rent from web service providers like Amazone Web Services (AWS) or Google Cloud Platform (GCP). Data scientists use two popular Python development environments for data analysis and reporting: Desktop IDE (PyCharm) and Notebooks (Jupyter).\n\n## Jupyter Nootebooks\n\nA Jupyter Notebook is a web-based, open-source tool that combines live code (like Python), equations, output, and narrative text (Markdown) into a single, interactive document. It is organized into cells and is a cornerstone of data science for combining execution and documentation, making analysis transparent and reproducible.\n\n## Debugging\n\n- Semantic errors: violating rules of coding language.\n- Syntax errors: missing code elements (e.g. parathesis).\n- Logical errors: correct syntax but incorrect directions causing undesired output.\n- Runtime errors: error happens when application is running or starting up.\n- ect.\n\n### Breakpoints\n\nBreakpoints define code locations where the execution shall stop. The execution is stopped before the selected line of code.\n\n### Debugger\n\nA debugger is a tool that allows developers to meticulously examine and control the execution of their code. It enables the setting of breakpoints, allowing the developer to inspect the current state of variables, the call stack (the sequence of function calls that led to the current point), and memory. This step-by-step execution, often called stepping (e.g., step over, step into, step out), is fundamental for isolating and understanding the root cause of bugs or unexpected behavior.\n\n## Enum data type\n\nAn Enum is a set of symbolic names bound to unique values. Enumeration requires the package Enum.\n\n::: {#d7f3b8f9 .cell execution_count=15}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nfrom enum import Enum\n```\n:::\n\n\nEnum allows handle a set of values:\n\n- days of the week\n- Colors\n- ect.\n\n# SW06: Functions, Strings & Files\n\n## Functions\n\nFunctions allow to combine multiple instruction into a function block that can be executed multiple times. Main advantages of functions are modularity (mitigates code duplication) and readability. Functions tackle only **one** particular issue at once. Ideally operate on its input only and produce some output.\n\n> Note: Functions are named by convention in snake case (i.e. lower case separated with ‘_’): `my_function()`.\n\nThe function header is made up of the function name and any optional parameters.\n\n> Note: Functions in Python are defined by the term `def`.\n\n::: {#c1382f85 .cell execution_count=16}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n# Name = my_function\n# Parameters: parameter1\ndef my_function(parameter1):\n    pass # Do nothing, just pass.\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe body of a function contains a sequence of operations and should always have an output value. The number of operations within a function is unlimited, and they can call other functions.\n\n::: {#cb82ff9b .cell execution_count=17}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\ndef my_function(parameter1):\n    print(parameter1) # Call the print function\n    return True\n\nmy_function(\"Test run\") # Call my_function\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nTest run\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=17}\n```\nTrue\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Return Values\n\nAll functions (including purely functional) have one return value; at least `None`. Return value is a pointer to a storage location.\n\n### Documentation\n\nPython offers a centralized documentation with docstrings; a built-in attribute assigned to each function named `__doc__`. If the `__doc__` attribute is set with a documentation string, it is callable by means of the `help()` function. You can place a string block (triple-quotes “””doc text”””) immediately next to the function definition to define the docstring.\n\n::: {#cfa177c4 .cell execution_count=18}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\ndef my_function(parameter1):\n    \"\"\" Prints a given parameter to the console \"\"\" # Docstring of my_function\n    print(parameter1) # Call the print function\n    return True\n```\n:::\n\n\n## String Formatting\n\nPython treats a string as a sequence (list) of characters (single letters, symbols or escape characters). Strings can be sliced, concatenated, allows index based access and formatting based on character position.\n\n![String as a sequence of characters](img/string_format.png)\n\nFormatting strings means defining the representation and treatment of particular sequences.\n\n### f-Strings\n\nAn f-string can be used to add variables to a string. Rather than writing the string again every time the variable changes, we can use the f-string to add multiple variables to the string.\n\n::: {#25335321 .cell execution_count=19}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nfor i in range(1, 5):\n    # Using f-String\n    print(f\"i is {i}\") # i changes over time\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\ni is 1\ni is 2\ni is 3\ni is 4\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## File Handling\n\nFiles enable storing data outside of the application and hence to keep the information for next execution or share data between different application. Python accesses files through a file object.\n\n```python\nfile_object = open(file_name, mode)\n```\n\n::: {.callout-important}\nThe buffer results in unfinished writing process as long as the file stream (file_object) is not flushed by '`file_object.flush()` or `file_object.close()`'.\n:::\n\n# SW07: Functions part II Recursion\n\n## Namespace\n\nNamespace is the definition of the visibility of a unique name for every single object (variables or methods). Object names must only be unique within a given namespace. Hence, the global namespace can have multiple local namespaces having objects with the same naming. The scope of an object refers to the code section from which an object is accessible.\n\n- built-in: encompasses no programmer defined objects. Ends when the application ends.\n- global: programmer defined objects available across the whole script. Ends when the module (i.e. script) is unloaded or the application ends.\n- local: programmer defined objects in function blocks. Ends when the function (i.e. block) has been finished.\n\n## Local and Global Variables\n\nPython allows creating variables without any restricted visibility. This variables in the global scope are accessible in the whole\nscript and are called global variables. Local variables being restricted to a specific function block.\n\n::: {#96344bf0 .cell execution_count=20}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nglobal_var = 123 # Free/Global variable\n\ndef my_function():\n    local_var = \"Hello\" # Local variable\n    print(local_var, global_var)\n\n# The function can use both variables\nmy_function()\n\n# This is not possible!\n# print(local_var)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nHello 123\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Keyword `global`\n\nIn some problem solutions it is meaningful to have a global variable which gets updated from within a local scope of a function.\n\n::: {#d3e5ba5e .cell execution_count=21}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\ncounter = 10\nprint(counter)\n\ndef reset():\n    global counter\n    counter = 0\n    print(f\"Counter reseted: {counter}\")\n\nreset()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n10\nCounter reseted: 0\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n> Note: It's best practice to avoid global variables.\n\n### Keyword `nonelocal`\n\nThe Python keywords `global` and `nonlocal` target different scope levels when modifying a variable from within a function.\n\n::: {#5b6d8123 .cell execution_count=22}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\ndef outer():\n    enclosing_var = 20\n\n    def inner():\n        nonlocal enclosing_var\n        enclosing_var = 200\n\n        global global_var\n        global_var = 100\n\n        print(f\"Inner: global_var={global_var}, enclosing_var={enclosing_var}\")\n\n    inner()\n    print(f\"Outer: global_var={global_var}, enclosing_var={enclosing_var}\")\n\nprint(f\"Start Global: {global_var}\")\nouter()\nprint(f\"End Global: {global_var}\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nStart Global: 123\nInner: global_var=100, enclosing_var=200\nOuter: global_var=100, enclosing_var=200\nEnd Global: 100\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Parameter Value\n\nParameters are always refernces to arguments.

It's a powerful way to model real-world entities and relationships in your code, leading to more modular, reusable, and scalable applications.\n\n## Classes\n\nAssembly instructions for box construction are represented by the class. The produced boxes, all with the same set of tools but different property values, are called objects. In Python everything is an object and variables hold references to these objects. This means, when you assign an object to a variable, you actually create a reference to that object in memory.\n\nA class in python consist of several elements:\n- **header** with class name indicates the beginning of a class description.\n- __init__() method: The constructor constructs a new object of the class. \n- **variables**: class: Variables belonging to the class description. Object: variables belonging to a particular object.\n- **methods** (functions): Class: methods provided by the class description. Object: methods provided by the object.\n- **self** attribute: Reference to the object: required to access object attributes.\n\n::: {#cf1d2998 .cell execution_count=27}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nclass MyClass(): # The class\n    def __init__(self): # Initial function\n        pass\n\n    def my_function(): # Methode of the class object\n        pass\n```\n:::\n\n\n> Note: For class names, we use CamelCase instead of underscores, as in function names.\n\n### `__init__`\n\nGenerating a new object, requires calling the class name and defining the specific properties by attributes passed to the constructor. Each time when generating a new object, python calls the constructor and passes the “properties” (attributes) to the __init__() method.\n\n### Methodes and variables\n\nThe class definition fully describes the class (i.e. the object). It comprises a mix of all variables and methods provided for the whole class and particular objects. Methods and variables are called with the object or by reference (self-keyword), respectively. Similarly to variables, methods can belong to an object or a class itself. The declaration and call is the same as for regular functions, yet always requires a reference\n\n::: {#59a58229 .cell execution_count=28}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nclass MyClass(): # The class\n    def __init__(self): # Initial function\n        pass\n\n    def my_function(self): # Methode of the class object\n        pass\n    \n    @classmethod\n    def class_function(cls): # Methode only of of the class\n        pass\n```\n:::\n\n\n> Note: The keyword `cls` is a convention but not necessary.\n\n### `self`\n\nThe self keyword points to the object it belongs to (namely itself). It allows to call or apply a variable and method, respectively, of (on) a particular object.\n\n## Method types\n\n### Object Methods\n\nBelong to a particular object. Modifying object’s state.\n\n```python\ndef change_obj_state(self):\n        self.state = \"New State\"\n        return True\n```\n\n### Class Methods\n\nBelong to a particular class. Modifying class’ state.\n\n```python\n@classmethod\ndef change_cls_state(cls):\n    cls.state = \"New State\"\n    return True\n```\n\n### Static Methods\n\nDon’t belong to object nor class. Provide operations independent of any object or class state.\n\n```python\n@staticmethod\ndef utility_func():\n    print(\"Done\")\n    return True\n```\n\n### Dunder Methodes\n\nDunder Methods (or Magic methods), are special methods in Python classes marked by double leading and trailing underscores (e.g., `__init__`, `__str__`).\n\n### `__str__()`\n\nBy implementing a __str__() method, the programmer can define what is printed when an object of an own class is passed to the print function.\n\n```python\ndef __str__(self):\n    return self.cls_name\n```\n# SW09: Object-Orientated Programming II\n\n## Inheritance\n\nInheritance creates a hierarchy of classes. This avoids code redundance and increase maintainability. Use the function `sinstance(object, classinfo)` or `issubclass(class, classinfo)` to check if an instance is a subclass of a other class. Child classes get all properties (attributes) from parent class. This means, class or object variables or methods defined in the parent class also hold in the child classes. Typically, child classes extend parent classes. In some cases, a child class can override variables or methods from parent class.\n\n```python\nclass Animal:\n    def __init__(self, weight):\n        self.weight = weight\n\nclass Bird(Animal):\n    def __init__(self, weight):\n        super().__init__(weight) # Inheritance from the parent class\n```\n\nWhen extending functionality of parent class by overriding a method (or in general to use parent’s methods), they can be referred to using super() or parent’s class name.\n\n```python\nclass Animal:\n    def __init__(self, weight):\n        self.weight = weight\n\n    def get_weight(self):\n        return self.weight\n\nclass Bird(Animal):\n    def __init__(self, weight):\n        super().__init__(weight)\n\n    def get_weight(self):\n        return super().get_weight()/10\n```\n\n### The Class “object”\n\nThis is the ultimate base class of all other classes. It has methods that are common to all instances of Python classes. When the constructor is called, it returns a new featureless object. The constructor does not accept any arguments.\n\n## Multiple Inheritance\n\n- Single inheritance: **one** child class inherits from **one** parent class.\n- Multiple single inheritance: **multiple** child classes inherit from **one** parent (the same) class.\n- Multiple inheritance: **one** child class inherits from **multiple** parent classes.\n\n## Method Resolution Order (MRO)\n\nThe Method Resolution Order (MRO) is the order in which Python searches for methods and attributes in a class hierarchy. It dictates the sequence of base classes that are checked when a method is called on an object of a derived class, especially in cases of multiple inheritance (where a class inherits from more than one parent). The MRO is essential for making multiple inheritance reliable and predictable.\n\n::: {.callout-note}\nThe `super()` function relies entirely on the MRO. When you call `super().method()`, Python uses the MRO list to find the next class in the hierarchy after the current class that implements `method()`, ensuring that base class methods are called in the correct, standardized order.\n:::\n\n## Access Modifiers\n\nSince Python is a script language and does not compile code in advance to execution, it lacks of keywords defining attribute’s accessibility. Yet, there is a convention in the naming of attributes using `_` for protected and for `__` private attributes for treating access restrictions.\n\n> Note: This is only a convention. Python has no hard restrictions and allows to access all attributes on object level.\n\n# SW10: Modules and Packages\n\n## Modules\n\nA module is a file containing Python definitions and statements. We can use modules for better structuring the source code of the whole application.\n\n### Import\n\nIn order to access content of other modules, they can be imported to a module as whole or parts of it.\n\n```python\nimport numpy                # Declares reference to module \nimport numpy as np          # Renames reference to\nfrom numpy import array     # Declares reference to specific attribute\nfrom numpy import *         # Declares references to “all” attributes\n```\n\nWhen imported, attributes of external modules are accessed differently, depending on the import.\n\n::: {.callout-note}\nWhen it comes to aliases for frequently used modules, there are conventions.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom matplotplib import pyplot as plt\n```\n:::\n\nReferring to external modules and files require either absolute or relative references. By default, root is set to the main executed script. The main executed script only allows absolute path. By default, imported modules are searched relative to the script path. For this case, the module sys allows to extend the search space for imported modules.\n\n```python\nsys.path.append('C:\\\\Users\\\\additional\\\\location')      # Windows\nsys.path.append('/home/username/additional/location')   # Linux\n```\n\n## `If __name__ == “__main__”:`\n\nThe `If __name__ == “__main__”:` block determines how a Python file is being executed.\n\n- If the file is run directly (as the main script), the variable `__name__` is set to `\"__main__\"`, and the code inside the block runs. This is where you put your application's main execution logic (e.g., calling your primary function).\n- If the file is imported as a module into another script, `__name__` is set to the module's name, and the code inside the block is skipped. This allows the file to be used as a reusable library without triggering unwanted side effects.\n\nThis structure allows a single Python file to be both runnable and importable.\n\n## Packaging\n\nPython enables to structure project resources using packages. a folder becomes a package as soon as it comprises\na script named `__init__.py`\n\n> Note: Since Python 3.3, there has been no need to declare an `__init__.py` file for packages, but it is still good practice.\n\n### The `__init__.py` Script\n\nObjects defined in the __init__.py are bound to names in the package’s namespace.\n\n## External Packages\n\nThe Python Software Foundation hosts an own repository for official Python packages called [PyPI](pypi.org). `pip` is a command-line interface (CLI) tool for installing Python packages.\n\n```python\npip install <packages>\npip unistall <packages>\npip list\npip freeze # Output in requirement format\n```\n\n# SW11: Must have Data Science Packages\n\n## Data Manipulation\n\n### Numpy\n\nNumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing in Python. It is a Python library that provides a multidimensional array object, various derived objects, and an assortment of routines for fast operations on arrays.\n\n#### Multidimensional Array objects \n\nMultidimensional array object (`ndarray`) are sequences, matrices or multidimensional matrices of numerical values. Important differences between NumPy arrays and the standard Python sequences are:\n\n- Fixed size at creation. Changing size of `ndarray` creates new array.\n- All elements are required to be of the same data type.\n- NumPy arrays facilitate advanced mathematical and other types of operations on large numbers of data.\n\n### Pandas\n\nPandas is a fast, powerful, flexible and easy to use open source data analysis and manipulation tool, built on top of the Python programming language.\n\n- **Fast DataFrame Object:** A core, efficient object for data manipulation with **integrated indexing**.\n- **I/O Capabilities:** Easy **reading and writing** of data across various formats (CSV, Excel, SQL, HDF5).\n- **Data Handling:** **Intelligent data alignment** and integrated **missing data handling**.\n- **Aggregation:** A powerful **group by engine** for split-apply-combine operations.\n\n#### Data Frames\n\nData frames are tabular data structure commonly used in data analysis and statistical computing.\n\n- Columns represent variables (features).\n- Rows represent observations (records).\n- Indexing by labels or numerical indices: [row, col]\n\n::: {.callout-note}\nA series is a one dimensional data (index and one column of a data frame).\n:::\n\n## Data Visualization\n\n### Matplotlib\n\nMatplotlib is a low-level library that provides a lot of flexibility and control over the creation of plots. Matplotlib has three fundamental components used for creating and managing plots:\n\n- Pyplot: a collection of functions to create figures.\n- Figure object: represents the entire figure in which you can plot one or more axes.\n- Axes object: represents a single or a set of plots within a figure. This is the area where data is plotted.\n\n### Seaborn\n\nBuilt on top of Matplotlib, Seaborn is a high-level library specifically designed for statistical data visualization. Since seaborn builds on top of matplotlib, it is mandatory to import pyplot from matplotlib in order to add titles or show the plot directly.\n\n## Jupyter Notebook\n\nJupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text. It is widely used for data analysis, scientific research, machine learning, and educational purposes.\n\n- Interactive Code Execution: write and execute code in a cell-based format, allowing for iterative development and testing.\n- Rich Text Support: include [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) for formatting text, including headings, lists, links, and images.\n- Visualizations: create and display plots and figures inline, making it easy to visualize data alongside your code.\n- Report: export the notebook as HTML or PDF, allows for having a report always ready.\n\n# SW12: Short Functions\n\n## Deep vs. Shallow Copy\n\nPython only has objects and references to them. So, variables are always references to objects stored in the memory in one\nor more storage cells. Consequently, when copying a variable, we copy the reference to a particular object – not the object itself.\n\n::: {#d3ada60b .cell execution_count=29}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n# Define a var\nx = 123\ny = x # Copy x to y\n\n# Both vars have the same memory location\nprint(id(x))\nprint(id(y))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n11764584\n11764584\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nTo create a copy of a sequence object with a new reference (ie. id), sequence objects implement the `copy()` method.\n\n> Note: The method `copy()` is only available for mutable objects.\n\nCopying a sequence returns a shallow copy of the object only. References to sub-sequences still remain the same and are affected by the same side-effect as when duplicating the reference by reassignment.\n\n## Lambda Function\n\n### Concept\n\nWhen associating a function to a variable, this can be done directly without function declaration first. Associated to a variable, they can be called as regular functions by the variable as reference instead of the function name. are typically used for expressions in combination with filter functions such as for the `map()` or `sort()` functions.\n\n#### `map()`-Function\n\nApplies a function to every single item of an iterable.\n\n::: {#d5e12402 .cell execution_count=30}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nmy_list = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]\n# Divide every value from the list by 2\nnew_list = list(map(lambda x: int(x/2), my_list))\nprint(my_list)\nprint(new_list)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[2, 4, 6, 8, 10]\n[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n#### `sort()`-Function\n\nSorts an iterable based on a given comparator.\n\n::: {#834e1d88 .cell execution_count=31}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nmy_list = [4, 10, 6, 2, 8]\n# Sort the values in reverse order\nmy_list.sort(key=lambda x: -x)\nprint(my_list)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[10, 8, 6, 4, 2]\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## List Comprehension\n\nInstead iterating a list with a for loop for applying a single expression on each element, a single expression can be applied in a simpler way on one line using a list comprehension.\n\n::: {#77241a9f .cell execution_count=32}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nmy_list = [1, 2, 3]\nnew_list = []\n# Iterate over a list\nfor value in my_list:\n    new_list.append(value * 2)\nprint(f\"Original list: {my_list}\")\nprint(f\"New list with loop: {new_list}\")\n\n### IS THE SAME AS ###\n\nmy_list = [value * 2 for value in my_list]\nprint(f\"New list with comprehension {my_list}\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nOriginal list: [1, 2, 3]\nNew list with loop: [2, 4, 6]\nNew list with comprehension [2, 4, 6]\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::: {.callout-note}\nComprehensions can be applied in-place\n:::\n\nComprehensions only apply a single expression on each list element. However, it provides the option defining conditions for the elements on that it should be applied.\n\n::: {#266fdf7a .cell execution_count=33}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nmy_list = [1, 2, 3, 4]\n# Only double even values from the list\nmy_list = [value * 2 if value % 2 == 0 else value for value in my_list]\nprint(my_list)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1, 4, 3, 8]\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n> Note: The single expression can also be a regular function\n\n### Nested Loops\n\ncomprehension allow to apply expressions to multi-dimensional lists – nested list comprehension.\n\n::: {#570e4c85 .cell execution_count=34}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nmy_list = [[1, 1], [2, 2], [3, 3]]\nnew_list = []\n# Iterate over both lists\nfor coordinate in my_list:\n    new_coordinate = []\n    for entry in coordinate:\n        new_coordinate.append(entry * 2)\n    new_list.append(new_coordinate)\nprint(f\"Original list: {my_list}\")\nprint(f\"New list with loop: {new_list}\")\n\n### IS THE SAME AS ###\n\nmy_list = [[entry * 2 for entry in coordinate] for coordinate in my_list]\nprint(f\"New list with comprehension {my_list}\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nOriginal list: [[1, 1], [2, 2], [3, 3]]\nNew list with loop: [[2, 2], [4, 4], [6, 6]]\nNew list with comprehension [[2, 2], [4, 4], [6, 6]]\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Tuples\n\nDespite the similarity between tuple and list in Python, there exist no tuple comprehension.Generating a tuple with a comprehension requires an explicit typecast `tuple()` or a tweak using unpacking operator for variable assignment.\n\n::: {#55d4d8b5 .cell execution_count=35}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nmy_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 4)\n\nx = tuple([i*2 for i in my_tuple])\nprint(f\"With typecast: {x}\")\n\ny = *[i*2 for i in my_tuple],\nprint(f\"With unpacking operator: {y}\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nWith typecast: (2, 4, 6, 8)\nWith unpacking operator: (2, 4, 6, 8)\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Dictionary\n\nDictionary comprehension requires the format of dictionary elements as expression results.\n\n::: {#28088511 .cell execution_count=36}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nx = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n\nd1 = {i:i for i in x}\nprint(d1)\nd2 = {k:v for (k,v) in enumerate(x)}\nprint(d2)\nd3 = {k:v for (k,v) in zip([\"a\", \"b\", \"c\", \"d\", \"e\"], x)}\nprint(d3)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n{1: 1, 2: 2, 3: 3, 4: 4, 5: 5}\n{0: 1, 1: 2, 2: 3, 3: 4, 4: 5}\n{'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3, 'd': 4, 'e': 5}\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Type Annotation\n\nThe Python runtime does not enforce function and variable type annotations. They can be used by third party tools such as type checkers, IDEs, linters, etc. In particular, we only define the type (any Python class) of references separated by colon (`:`) and arrows (`->`).\n\n```python\nx: int = 10 # Var x is an integer\ndef my_function(x: int) # The param x has to be an integer\ndef my_function(x) -> int: # The function returns an integer\n```\n\n## Assert Function\n\nPython’s `assert` statement allows you to write sanity checks in your code. These checks are known as assertions, and you can use them to test if certain assumptions remain true while you’re developing your code. If any of your assertions turn false, it indicates a bug by raising an `AssertionError`.\n\n::: {#50ff1f31 .cell execution_count=37}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\ndef division(a, b):\n    assert b != 0, \"Division by Zero\" # Divider can't be Zero\n    \n    res = a / b\n    return res\n```\n:::\n\n\n# SW 14: Exceptions, Generators, Decorators\n\n## Exceptions\n\n```python\ntry:\n    num = input('Enter a number: ')\n    frac = 1/int(num)\nexcept ValueError as e:\n    print('no number given:', e)\nexcept ZeroDivisionError:\n    print('can not divide by 0')\nexcept:\n    print('any other error happend')\nelse:\n    print(f'the fraction is: {frac}')\nfinally:\n    print('leaving try-except clause')\n```\n\n### Custom Error\n\n```python\nclass CustError(Exception):\n    def __init__(self, message):\n        super().__init__(message)\n        # customize error code...\n        self.errors = \"custom error\"\n```\n\nAn error can be raised at any position in the script using the keyword: `raise`\n\n```python\nif input(‘enter number: ‘) == ‘0’:\n    raise CustError(‘customized error message’)\n```\n\n## Assert Statement\n\n`assert` can be useful for sanity checks in development, testing, and debugging phase but can get optimized away in production code (proper exception handling).\n\n```python\nx = 21\nassert isinstance(x, int), 'Value should be of type int'\n```\n\n## Generators\n\nImagine you have a list with a billion numbers. If you save this as a normal list, your working memory (RAM) would immediately become full. An iterator, on the other hand, only calculates or loads the element that is currently needed. The generator function is like a regular function, yet using the `yield` keyword instead of `return`. To understand the concept in Python, this distinction helps:\n\n- Iterable: An object that you can use in a for loop (e.g., list, string, dictionary). It has the __iter__ method.\n- Iterator: The object that actually does the work. It has the __next__ method and returns the values to you one after the other.\n\n## Decorators\n\nTechnically speaking, a decorator is a function that takes another function as an argument, extends its behavior, and then returns it.\n\n```python\nimport time\nfrom functools import wraps\n\ndef timer(func):\n    \"\"\"A decorator that measures the execution time of a function.\"\"\"\n    @wraps(func) # Best practice: keeps the original function's name and docstring\n    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):\n        # 1. Action before the function call\n        start_time = time.time()\n        \n        # 2. Execute the actual function\n        result = func(*args, **kwargs)\n        \n        # 3. Action after the function call\n        end_time = time.time()\n        duration = end_time - start_time\n        print(f\"Duration of {func.__name__}: {duration:.4f} seconds\")\n        \n        # 4. Return the result of the original function\n        return result\n    return wrapper\n\n@timer\ndef long_computation():\n    \"\"\"Simulates a heavy task.\"\"\"\n    time.sleep(2)\n    print(\"Computation finished!\")\n\n# Calling the decorated function\nlong_computation()\n```\n\n",
