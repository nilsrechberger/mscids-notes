It is a branch of philosophy that deals with the theory of scientific knowledge and scientific methods, as well as with research. It also analyzes the practices that generate scientific knowledge and examines the institutional and social contexts in which these take place.\n\n\nMethodology\nIt focuses on the underlying considerations, decisions, and justifications of the approach used in scientific research projects. It provides the instructional framework on how to proceed in order to gain scientific knowledge. It does not comprise a strictly formal set of rules but offers a diverse and pragmatic set of choices that are linked to human action.\n\n\nResearch Methodes\nSystematized procedures and approaches for obtaining knowledge.\n\n\nSelection of positions held in scientific theory\n\nClassical rationalism: Reason precedes experience and there are so-called “innate” concepts of reason.\nInductive empiricism: Findings are derived inductively based on observations and experiences.\nLogical positivism: The use of logic makes it possible to separate science from metaphysics.\nCritical rationalism: Findings are derived deductively based on observations.\n(Social) constructivism: Individuals construct their reality by relating their thinking and actions.\n\n\nNote: Inductive empiricism and critical rationalism belong to empirical research.\n\n\n\nWhat is empirical research?\nKnowledge can be gained only through observation, experiment, and experience. Empirical research examines the environment by means of observation and experiment. There are many research methods for conducting observations and experiments:\n\nInterview\nCase study\nSurvey study\nExperiment\n\n\n\nLandscape of empirical research\n\n\n\nLandscape of empirical research\n\n\n\n\nQuantitative Methodes\nResearch that uses quantitative methods is designed around the principles of critical rationalism. The approach assumes that a theory can never be finally verified, it can only be falsified.\n\n\nDescriptive statistics\n\nDescribes the data to be analyzed.\nIs limited to a sample as a subset of the population.\nDoes not allow for conclusions to be drawn about the population.\n\n\n\nInferential statistics\n\nFor drawing conclusions about the population based on information obtained from a sample.\nUse statistical hypothesis tests, especially, as the main component.\n\n\n\nHypothesis Testing\nHypothesis testing is a statistical method used to determine if there is enough evidence in a sample of data to support a specific hypothesis about a population. It involves formulating a null hypothesis and an alternative hypothesis, analyzing sample data, and making a decision based on the results, often using a p-value to assess significance.\n\nAlternative hypothesis (\\(H_A\\)): Research hypothesis to be tested that postulates the presence of a certain effect (e.g. a difference) in the population.\nNull hypothesis (\\(H_0\\)): Postulates the opposite, namely the absence of an effect."

Think only about how to use the smaller solution to get the larger one Do not worry about how to solve to smaller problem (it will be solved using an even smaller one).\n\n\nRecursion\nRecursion is a method of solving a problem where the solution depends on solutions to smaller instances of the same problem.

It sequentially checks each element of the list until a match is found or the whole list has been searched. A linear search runs in at worst linear time and makes at most \\(n\\) comparisons.\n\nBinary Search\nBinary search is a search algorithm that finds the position of a target value within a sorted list of values. Binary search compares the target value to the middle element of the list. If they are not equal, the half in which the target cannot lie is eliminated and the search continues on the remaining half, again taking the middle element to compare to the target value, and repeating this until the target value is found."

    "text": "Virtualization\nVirtualization is essentially a way to trick a computer into thinking it is running multiple separate machines, all on the same physical hardware. It lets you run many independent operating systems (called Virtual Machines or VMs) side-by-side. The piece of software that makes this possible is called a Hypervisor.\nThere are two main types of Hypervisors:\n- Type 1 (Bare-Metal): This is the most powerful type. It is installed directly onto the physical hardware, without needing an operating system underneath it. It manages the server's resources (CPU, RAM, etc.) immediately. Because it has direct access to the hardware, it is very fast, efficient, and secure. This type is used mainly in large data centers and enterprise servers (e.g., VMware ESXi).\n\n- Type 2 (Hosted): This type is installed like a regular application on top of a host operating system (like Windows or macOS). It relies on the host OS to manage the hardware. This makes it easier for casual use, development, and testing on a personal computer, but it is less efficient and slower than Type 1 (e.g., VirtualBox).\n\nKey Advantages of Using Virtualization\nThe main benefit is efficiency. You can run many servers on just one physical machine, which is called server consolidation. This saves a lot of money on buying hardware, paying for electricity (power), and cooling. It also improves security because if one VM gets a virus, the others stay isolated. Finally, it makes tasks like backup and disaster recovery much easier, as you can quickly move or restore an entire VM onto different hardware."

    "text": "Introduction\nPython inherently offers useful functionalities such as print(), enumerate(), or list.append(). However, our projects often require more specific tools. This is where packages (or libraries) come in. Packages are extensions for Python that provide specialized functions and tools to efficiently solve a variety of problems.\nThe most frequently used packages include:\n\nnumpy: For fast numerical and mathematical computations.\npandas: For the efficient processing of large amounts of structured data (tables).\nmatplotlib: For creating data visualizations and diagrams.\n\nInstead of treating every function of these packages in detail, which would be too extensive, this summary focuses on practical application examples for each presented package.\n\n\nNumPy\nTransposing a matrix means swapping rows and columns. If \\(A\\) is a matrix, then its transposed matrix \\(A^T\\) is defined by:\n\\[\n(A^T)_{ij} = A_{ji}\n\\]\nIf one were to perform a matrix transposition with pure Python, one would have to manually iterate over rows and columns, leading to comparatively inefficient code.\n\nmatrix = [[1, 2], [3, 4]]\nrows = len(matrix)\ncols = len(matrix[0])\ntransposed = []\n\nfor i in range(cols):\n    new_row = []\n    for j in range(rows):\n        new_row.append(matrix[j][i])\n    transposed.append(new_row)\n\nprint(transposed)\n\n[[1, 3], [2, 4]]\n\n\nDepending on the size of the matrix, this process can be very time-consuming. With NumPy, we can use the optimized transposition function to solve this problem quickly and elegantly. NumPy operations are vectorized and run with significantly better performance.\n\nimport numpy as np\n\nmatrix = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])\ntransposed = matrix.T\n\nprint(transposed)\n\n[[1 3]\n [2 4]]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nCheck out the Numpy Cheat Sheet.\n\n\n\n\nPandas\nWorking with structured data in native Python is possible, but quickly becomes complicated and error-prone with larger data sets.
