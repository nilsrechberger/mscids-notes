    "text": "Linar Algebra is the theory of linear mappings between vector spaces. Broadly the theory of certain (linear) data transformation (manipulation). The main actors are vectors and matrices.\n\n\nA vector \\(\\overrightarrow{a}\\) is data of a number (or magnitude) and a direction. Vertical brunch of numbers. Vector is defined only by length and direction. Two arrows represent same vector if one is a parallel translation (shift) of the other one. Vector determined by giving initial and terminal points of a representative, also called tail and head of the vector. Vector \\(\\overrightarrow{PQ}\\) defined by the arrow with initial point \\(P\\) (tail) and terminal point \\(Q\\) (head).\n\nNote: Position of arrow is not relevant.\n\n\\[\n\\overrightarrow{a} = \\begin{bmatrix}\n1 \\\\\n-3 \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\n\nThe sum of two vectors calculates componet-wise.
