    "text": "Linear algebra is the theory of linear mappings between vector spaces. Broadly, it’s the theory of certain linear data transformations or manipulations. The main actors are vectors and matrices.\n\n\nA vector \\(\\overrightarrow{a}\\) is data of a number (or magnitude) and a direction. A vector is defined only by its length and direction. Two arrows represent the same vector if one is a parallel translation (shift) of the other. A vector is determined by giving the initial and terminal points of a representative, also called the tail and head of the vector. A vector, such as \\(\\overrightarrow{PQ}\\), is defined by the arrow with initial point \\(P\\) (tail) and terminal point \\(Q\\) (head).\n\nNote: The position of the arrow is not relevant.\n\n\\[\n\\overrightarrow{a} = \\begin{bmatrix}\n1 \\\\\n-3 \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\n\nThe sum of two vectors is calculated component-wise. The summation of vectors is commutative and associative, includes a neutral element (the zero vector), and can be inverted by its negative vector to result in the zero vector.\n\\[\n\\overrightarrow{a} + \\overrightarrow{b} = \\begin{bmatrix}\n1 \\\\\n-3 \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n+\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n4 \\\\\n-1 \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n5 \\\\\n-2 \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\n\n\nThe difference of two vectors \\(\\overrightarrow{a}\\) and \\(\\overrightarrow{b}\\) is the sum of \\(\\overrightarrow{a}\\) and the opposite of \\(\\overrightarrow{b}\\).\n\\[\n\\overrightarrow{a} - \\overrightarrow{b} = \\overrightarrow{a} + (-\\overrightarrow{b})\n\\]\n\n\n\nScalar multiplication of a vector involves multiplying each component of the vector by a scalar (a real number). This changes the magnitude of the vector, keeping its direction the same if the scalar is positive or reversing it if the scalar is negative.

It’s a branch of philosophy that deals with the theory of scientific knowledge and scientific methods, and with research. Also analyzes the practices that generate scientific knowledge and examines their institutional and social context in which these take place.\n\n\nMethodology\nFocuses on the underlying considerations, decisions and justifications of the approach used in scientific research projects. Provides the instructional framework on how to proceed in order to gain scientific knowledge. Does not comprise a strictly formal set of rules but offers a diverse and pragmatic set of choices that are linked to human action.\n\n\nResearch Methodes\nSystematized procedures and approaches for obtaining knowledge.\n\n\nSelection of positions held in scientific theory\n\nClassical rationalism: Reason precedes experience and there are so-called “innate” concepts of reason.\nInductive empiricism: Findings are derived inductively based on observations and experiences.\nLogical positivism: The use of logic makes it possible to separate science from metaphysics.\nCritical rationalism: Findings are derived deductively based on observations.\n(Social) constructivism: Individuals construct their reality by relating their thinking and actions.\n\n\nNote: Inductive empiricism and Critical rationalism belongs to the empirical researches.\n\n\n\nWhat is empirical research?\nKnowledge can be gained only through observation, experiment and experience. Empirical research looks at the environment by means of observation and experiment. There are many research methods for conducting observations and experiments:\n\nInterview\nCase study\nSurvey study\nExperiment\n\n\n\nLandscape of empirical research\n\n\n\nLandscape of empirical research\n\n\n\n\nQuantitative Methodes\nResearch that uses quantitative methods is designed around the principles of critical rationalism. The approach assumes that a theory can never be finally verified, it can only be falsified.\n\n\nQualitative Methodes\nTBD\n\n\nDescriptive statistics\n\nDescribes the data to be analyzed.\nIs limited to a sample as a subset of the population.\nDoes not allow for conclusions to be drawn about the population.\n\n\n\nInferential statistics\n\nFor drawing conclusions about the population based on information obtained from a sample.\nUse statistical hypothesis tests, especially, as the main component.\n\n\n\nHypothesis Testing\nHypothesis testing is a statistical method used to determine if there is enough evidence in a sample of data to support a specific hypothesis about a population. It involves formulating a null hypothesis and an alternative hypothesis, analyzing sample data, and making a decision based on the results, often using a p-value to assess significance.\n\nAlternative hypothesis (\\(H_A\\)): esearch hypothesis to be tested that postulates the presence of a certain effect (e.g. a difference) in the population.\nNull hypothesis (\\(H_0\\)): Postulates the opposite, namely the absence of an effect."

    "text": "Hey there, fellow students! 👋\nHere you’ll find a collection of my personal notes and solutions from our courses. I’ve decided to put them online in the hopes that they might help some of you out.\n\nQuick Heads-Up! 📝\nJust a friendly reminder: everything you see here is based on my own understanding and approach. That means my solutions might be different from the official ones provided by our professors.\nThink of this as a secondary resource to complement your own work, not as an official answer key.\n\n\nDisclaimer 🚨\nWhile I do my best, I can’t guarantee that everything is 100% correct or complete. I’m just a student trying to figure things out, same as you. Therefore, I’m not taking any responsibility for the accuracy of the content. Always double-check with official course materials!\n\n\nSpotted a Mistake? 👀\nIf you happen to find an error, I’d be super grateful if you could let me know. Just shoot me a quick email!\n📧 nils.rechberger@stud.hslu.ch\nHappy studying! 🚀"
