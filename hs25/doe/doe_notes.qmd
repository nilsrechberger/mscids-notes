# Research Design

## Observational vs. Experimental
The fundamental difference between observational studies and experimental research designs is that in the former, researchers simply observe and measure variables without actively intervening. In the latter, variables are purposefully manipulated to determine a cause-and-effect relationship.

## Randomization
The effect and aim of randomisation is to eliminate selection bias and confounding factors, and to ensure comparability between groups at the start of the study (baseline data).

## Confounder
Confounding occurs when a factor (confounder) that has not been investigated is associated with both the independent and dependent variables, causing a spurious correlation between them.

## Blinding
The problem is distortion due to knowledge about the treatment. Blinding is a suitable technique for avoiding such distortions. It eliminates conscious and unconscious influences on the treatment result.

### Types of blining

- Open: No blining
- Single-blind: Participants don't know their group assignment (e.g., whether they're receiving the real treatment or a placebo).
- Double-blind: Neither the participants nor the researchers administering the treatment know the group assignments.
- Triple-blind: Participants, researchers, and the data analysts are all unaware of the group assignments.

# Principles

##  Introduction to scientific theory

### Scientific Theory

Examines whether and how scientific knowledge can be obtained. It's a branch of philosophy that deals with the theory of scientific knowledge and
scientific methods, and with research. Also analyzes the practices that generate scientific knowledge and examines their institutional and
social context in which these take place.

### Methodology

Focuses on the underlying considerations, decisions and justifications of the approach used in
scientific research projects. Provides the instructional framework on how to proceed in order to gain scientific knowledge. Does not comprise a strictly formal set of rules but offers a diverse and pragmatic set of choices that are linked to human action.

### Research Methodes

Systematized procedures and approaches for obtaining knowledge.

### Selection of positions held in scientific theory

- Classical rationalism: Reason precedes experience and there are so-called "innate" concepts of reason.
- Inductive empiricism: Findings are derived inductively based on observations and experiences.
- Logical positivism: The use of logic makes it possible to separate science from metaphysics.
- Critical rationalism: Findings are derived deductively based on observations.
- (Social) constructivism: Individuals construct their reality by relating their thinking and actions.

> Note: Inductive empiricism and Critical rationalism belongs to the empirical researches.

### What is empirical research?

Knowledge can be gained only through observation, experiment and experience. Empirical research looks at the environment by means of observation and experiment. There are many research methods for conducting observations and experiments:

- Interview
- Case study
- Survey study
- Experiment

### Quantitative Methodes

Research that uses quantitative methods is designed around the principles of critical rationalism. The approach assumes that a theory can never be finally verified, it can only be falsified.

### Qualitative Methodes

TBD

### Descriptive statistics

- Describes the data to be analyzed.
- Is limited to a sample as a subset of the population.
- Does not allow for conclusions to be drawn about the population.

### Inferential statistics

- For drawing conclusions about the population based on information obtained from a sample.
- Use statistical hypothesis tests, especially, as the main component.

### Hypothesis Testing

Hypothesis testing is a statistical method used to determine if there is enough evidence in a sample of data to support a specific hypothesis about a population. It involves formulating a null hypothesis and an alternative hypothesis, analyzing sample data, and making a decision based on the results, often using a p-value to assess significance.

- Alternative hypothesis ($H_A$): esearch hypothesis to be tested that postulates the presence of a certain effect (e.g. a difference) in the population.
- Null hypothesis ($H_0$): Postulates the opposite, namely the absence of an effect.

## Research process

### Phases

1. Formulation of the research problem & study design
2. Planning and preparation of the study
3. Data collection
4. Data Analysis
5. Reporting

### Measuring Instrument

TBD

### Sampling procedure

TBD

## Definition & properties of study design

The choice of a suitable research design determines the scientific quality of a study. The planning of the analysis depends on the research design.

### Study types

- Descriptive study: Descriptive character. Suitable for forming hypotheses (Surveys).
- Analytical study: Identification and quantification of effects / verification of relationships. Not fully suitable for hypothesis testing (Cohot).
- Randomized controlled: Suitable for hypothesis testing (RCT).
