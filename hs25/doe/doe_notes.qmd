# Researce Design

## Observational vs. Experimental

## Randomization
Effect and aim of randomization
Elimination of selection bias
Elimination of confounding
Ensuring the comparability of the groups at study initiation (Baseline Data)

## Confounder
Confounding means that a factor (Confounder) that is not directly investigated is associated with both the independent variable and the dependent variable and accordingly causes the relationship between the two variables (Spurious Correlation).

## Blinding
Problem of distortion due to knowledge about the treatment. Blinding is a suitable technique to avoid such distortions. Elimination of conscious and unconscious influences on the treatment result.

### Types of blining

- Open: No blining
- Single-blind: Test persons have no knowledge of group membership.
- Double-blind: Also, the persons carrying out the tests have no knowledge of group membership.
- Triple-blind: Also, people doing the analysis have no knowledge about group membership.
