# Research Design

## Observational vs. Experimental

Researchers simply observe and measure variables without actively intervening. In experiments, variables are purposefully manipulated to determine a cause-and-effect relationship.

## Randomization

The effect and aim of randomisation is to eliminate selection bias and confounding factors, and to ensure comparability between groups at the start of the study (baseline data).

## Confounder

Confounding occurs when a factor (confounder) that has not been investigated is associated with both the independent and dependent variables, causing a spurious correlation between them.

## Blinding

Blinding is a suitable technique for avoiding distortions. It eliminates conscious and unconscious influences on the treatment result.

### Types of blinding

- Open: No blinding
- Single-blind: Participants don't know their group assignment (e.g., whether they're receiving the real treatment or a placebo).
- Double-blind: Neither the participants nor the researchers administering the treatment know the group assignments.
- Triple-blind: Participants, researchers, and the data analysts are all unaware of the group assignments.

# Principles

##  Introduction to scientific theory

### Scientific Theory

It is a branch of philosophy that deals with the theory of scientific knowledge and scientific methods, as well as with research.

### Methodology

Provides the instructional framework on how to proceed in order to gain scientific knowledge. Systematized procedures and approaches for obtaining knowledge.

### Selection of positions held in scientific theory

- Classical rationalism: Reason precedes experience and there are so-called "innate" concepts of reason.
- Inductive empiricism: Findings are derived inductively based on observations and experiences.
- Logical positivism: The use of logic makes it possible to separate science from metaphysics.
- Critical rationalism: Findings are derived deductively based on observations.
- (Social) constructivism: Individuals construct their reality by relating their thinking and actions.

> Note: Inductive empiricism and critical rationalism belong to **empirical research**.

### What is empirical research?

Empirical research examines the environment by means of observation and experiment. There are many research methods for conducting observations and experiments (Interview, Case study, Survey, experiments, etc.)

### Quantitative Methodes

The approach assumes that a theory can never be finally verified, it can only be falsified.

### Descriptive statistics

Describes the data to be analyzed. Is limited to a sample as a subset of the population. Does not allow for conclusions to be drawn about the population.

### Inferential statistics

For drawing conclusions about the population based on information obtained from a sample. Use statistical hypothesis tests, especially, as the main component.

### Hypothesis Testing

Hypothesis testing is a statistical method used to determine if there is enough evidence in a sample of data to support a specific hypothesis about a population.

- Alternative hypothesis ($H_A$): Research hypothesis to be tested that postulates the presence of a certain effect (e.g. a difference) in the population.
- Null hypothesis ($H_0$): Postulates the opposite, namely the absence of an effect.

## Research process

### Phases

1. Formulation of the research problem & study design
2. Planning and preparation of the study
3. Data collection
4. Data Analysis
5. Reporting

### Measuring Instrument

A process that uses a given set of circumstances to define and specify subsequent research steps with a view to better understanding these circumstances.

### Sampling procedure

Process of selecting a representative subset of cases from a larger population to draw empirical conclusions about the whole.

### Study types

- Descriptive study: Descriptive character. Suitable for forming hypotheses (Surveys).
- Analytical study: Identification and quantification of effects / verification of relationships. Not fully suitable for hypothesis testing (Cohot).
- Randomized controlled: Suitable for hypothesis testing (RCT).
