# What is Linear Algebra
Linar Algebra is the theory of linear mappings between vector spaces. Broadly the theory of certain (linear) data transformation (manipulation). The main actors are vectors and matrices.

## Vector

Vertical brunch of numbers.

$$
b = \begin{bmatrix}
1 \\
-3 \\
2 \\
\end{bmatrix}
$$

## Matrice

Rectangular bunch of numbers.

$$
A = \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 3 & -7 \\
2 & 1 & 6 \\
4 & 0 & 1 \\
\end{bmatrix}
$$

# Mappings

After data transformation (mapping), patterns become visible which have not been
visible before or notions become very easy.
