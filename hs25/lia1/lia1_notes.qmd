# What is Linear Algebra

Linear algebra is the theory of linear mappings between vector spaces. Broadly, it's the theory of certain linear data transformations or manipulations. The main actors are vectors and matrices.

## Vectors

A vector $\overrightarrow{a}$ is data of a number (or magnitude) and a direction. A vector is defined only by its length and direction. Two arrows represent the same vector if one is a parallel translation (shift) of the other. A vector is determined by giving the initial and terminal points of a representative, also called the tail and head of the vector. A vector, such as $\overrightarrow{PQ}$, is defined by the arrow with initial point $P$ (tail) and terminal point $Q$ (head).

> Note: The position of the arrow is not relevant.

$$
\overrightarrow{a} = \begin{bmatrix}
1 \\
-3 \\
\end{bmatrix}
$$

### Sum of Vectors

The sum of two vectors is calculated component-wise. The summation of vectors is commutative and associative, includes a neutral element (the zero vector), and can be inverted by its negative vector to result in the zero vector.

$$
\overrightarrow{a} + \overrightarrow{b} = \begin{bmatrix}
1 \\
-3 \\
\end{bmatrix}
+ 
\begin{bmatrix}
4 \\
-1 \\
\end{bmatrix} 
=
\begin{bmatrix}
5 \\
-2 \\
\end{bmatrix}
$$

### Subtraction

The difference of two vectors $\overrightarrow{a}$ and $\overrightarrow{b}$ is the sum of $\overrightarrow{a}$ and the opposite of $\overrightarrow{b}$.

$$
\overrightarrow{a} - \overrightarrow{b} = \overrightarrow{a} + (-\overrightarrow{b})
$$

### Scalar Multiplication

Scalar multiplication of a vector involves multiplying each component of the vector by a scalar (a real number). This changes the magnitude of the vector, keeping its direction the same if the scalar is positive or reversing it if the scalar is negative. Scalar multiplication of vectors is associative and distributive and includes a neutral element (the scalar 1).

$$
\dfrac{1}{2}(\overrightarrow{a} + \overrightarrow{b})
= 
\dfrac{1}{2}(\begin{bmatrix}
2 \\
6 \\
\end{bmatrix}
+ 
\begin{bmatrix}
4 \\
2 \\
\end{bmatrix}) 
=
\begin{bmatrix}
3 \\
4 \\
\end{bmatrix}
$$

### Magniture (Norm)

The magnitude (or norm) of a vector $\overrightarrow{a}$ is its length, and it is denoted by $|\overrightarrow{a}|$.

$$
\lvert \vec{a} \rvert = \sqrt{a_x^2 + a_y^2}
$$

> Note: Length of vector is never negative: $\lvert \overrightarrow{a} \rvert \ge 0$.

### Zero Vector

The vector with a norm of zero is denoted by $\overrightarrow{0}$. The length of the zero vector is $0$.

$$
|\overrightarrow{0}| = 0
$$

> Note: A zero vector has no direction.

### Opposite Vector

The opposite vector of $\overrightarrow{a}$ is a vector with the same norm but the opposite direction. It is denoted as $-\overrightarrow{a}$. In a representative, the initial and terminal points are reversed.

> Note: $\overrightarrow{PQ} = -\overrightarrow{QP}$, but $\overrightarrow{PQ} \neq \overrightarrow{QP}$ 

### Unite Vector

A unit vector is a vector that has a magnitude of 1 and is often used to indicate direction.

$$
\lvert \overrightarrow{e} \rvert = 1
$$

### Collinearity

Two vectors $\overrightarrow{a}$ and $\overrightarrow{b}$ are called collinear or linearly dependent, if:

$$
\overrightarrow{b} = r \overrightarrow{a} \quad \text{for } r \in \mathbb{R}
$$
$$
s \overrightarrow{b} =  \overrightarrow{a} \quad \text{for } s \in \mathbb{R}
$$

More generally:
$$
r \overrightarrow{a} + s \overrightarrow{b} = \overrightarrow{0} \quad \text{for } r, s \in \mathbb{R} \quad \text{with } r \neq 0 \quad \text{or } s \neq 0
$$

This will be used to generalize definition of linear independence.

### Normalization

For every non-zero vector $\overrightarrow{a}$, there is exactly one unit vector ($\overrightarrow{e}_a$) with the same direction. This process is called normalizing a vector.

$$
\overrightarrow{e}_a = \dfrac{1}{\lvert \overrightarrow{a} \rvert}\overrightarrow{a}
$$

### Vectors between two points

$$
\overrightarrow{PQ}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
x_2 - x_1 \\
y_2 - y_1 \\
\end{bmatrix}
$$

## Cartesian Coordinate Systems

A Cartesian coordinate system is one in which the axes are perpendicular and the units on each axis have the same length. The unit vectors along the axes are typically denoted by $\overrightarrow{e}_x$ and $\overrightarrow{e}_y$. Every vector in this system can be represented as a linear combination of these unit vectors.

$$
\overrightarrow{a} = a_x\overrightarrow{e}_x + a_y\overrightarrow{e}_y
$$

> Note: $a_x$ and $a_y$ are called scalar components of $\overrightarrow{a}$.

## 3-D Space

Vectors in 3D space have an additional component to represent the third dimension.

$$
\overrightarrow{a} = \begin{bmatrix}
1 \\
-3 \\
2 \\
\end{bmatrix}
$$

> Note: The mathematical rules do not change by adding more dimensions.
