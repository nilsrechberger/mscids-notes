# What is Linear Algebra
Linar Algebra is the theory of linear mappings between vector spaces. Broadly the theory of certain (linear) data transformation (manipulation). The main actors are vectors and matrices.

## Vector

A vector $\overrightarrow{a}$ is data of a number (or magnitude) and a direction. Vertical brunch of numbers. Vector is defined only by length and direction. Two arrows represent same vector if one is a parallel translation (shift) of the other one. Vector determined by giving initial and terminal points of a representative, also called tail and head of the vector. Vector $\overrightarrow{PQ}$ defined by the arrow with initial point $P$ (tail) and terminal point $Q$ (head).

> Note: Position of arrow is not relevant.

$$
\overrightarrow{a} = \begin{bmatrix}
1 \\
-3 \\
\end{bmatrix}
$$

### Sum of Vectors

The sum of two vectors calculates componet-wise. Sumation of vecots are commutativ, associativ, can include neutrala elements (zero vector) and can be inversed by its negatove vector to the zero vecto.

$$
\overrightarrow{a} + \overrightarrow{b} = \begin{bmatrix}
1 \\
-3 \\
\end{bmatrix}
+ 
\begin{bmatrix}
4 \\
-1 \\
\end{bmatrix} 
=
\begin{bmatrix}
5 \\
-2 \\
\end{bmatrix}
$$

> Note: $\overrightarrow{a} + \overrightarrow{b} = \overrightarrow{b} + \overrightarrow{a}$

### Subtraction

Difference $\overrightarrow{a} - \overrightarrow{b}$ of two vectors $\overrightarrow{a}$ and $\overrightarrow{b}$ is sum of $\overrightarrow{a}$ and opposite
of $\overrightarrow{b}$

$$
\overrightarrow{a} - \overrightarrow{b} = \overrightarrow{a} + (-\overrightarrow{b})
$$

### Scalar Multiplication

Scalar multiplication of a vector involves multiplying each component of the vector by a scalar (a real number). This changes the magnitude of the vector while keeping its direction the same if the scalar is positive, or reversing it if the scalar is negative. Scalar multiplication of vecots are associativ, distributiv, can include neutrala elements (zero vector).

$$
\dfrac{1}{2}(\overrightarrow{a} + \overrightarrow{b})
= 
(\begin{bmatrix}
2 \\
6 \\
\end{bmatrix}
+ 
\begin{bmatrix}
4 \\
2 \\
\end{bmatrix}) 
=
\begin{bmatrix}
3 \\
4 \\
\end{bmatrix}
$$

> Note: Numbers come with unites. Component-wise multiplication does not make any sense in certan
cases.

### Magniture (Norm)
Magnitude or norm of vector $\overrightarrow{a}$ : Length of $\overrightarrow{a}$. Denoted by $|\overrightarrow{a}|$.

$$
|\overrightarrow{a}| = \sqrt{a_x² + a_y²}
$$

> Note: Length of vector is never negative: $\overrightarrow{a}| \ge 0$.

### Zero Vecor

Vector with norm zero denoted by $\overrightarrow{0}$. The length of zero vector is $0$

$$
|\overrightarrow{0}| = 0
$$

> Note: Zero vector has no direction.

### Opposite Vecor

Opposite vector of $\overrightarrow{a}$ is the same norm but with opposite direction (in a representative, initial and terminal points are reversed) of $-\overrightarrow{a}$.

> Note: $\overrightarrow{PQ} = -\overrightarrow{QP}$, but $\overrightarrow{PQ} \neq \overrightarrow{QP}$ 

### Unite Vector

TBD

### Collinearity

Two vectors $\overrightarrow{a}$ and $\overrightarrow{b}$ are called collinear or linearly dependent, if

$$
\overrightarrow{b} = r \overrightarrow{a} \quad \text{for } r \in \mathbb{R}
$$
$$
s \overrightarrow{b} =  \overrightarrow{a} \quad \text{for } s \in \mathbb{R}
$$

More generally.
$$
r \overrightarrow{a} + s \overrightarrow{b} = \overrightarrow{0} \quad \text{for } r, s \in \mathbb{R} \quad \text{with } r \neq 0 \quad \text{or } s \neq 0
$$

This will be used to generalize definition of linear independence.

### Normalization

For every vector there is axactly one unite vector ($\overrightarrow{e}_a$) with the same direction, which normalize a vector.

$$
\overrightarrow{e}_a = \dfrac{1}{|\overrightarrow{a}|}\overrightarrow{a}
$$

### Vectors between two points

$$
\overrightarrow{PQ}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
x_2 - x_1 \\
y_2 - y_1 \\
\end{bmatrix}
$$

## Cartesian Coordinate Systems
Cartesian coordinate system whose axes are perpendicular and units on axes have same length 1 with $\overrightarrow{e}_x$ and $\overrightarrow{e}_y$. Every vector in this system can be represented by the unit vecorts.

$$
\overrightarrow{a} = a_x\overrightarrow{e}_x + a_y\overrightarrow{e}_y
$$

$a_x$ and $a_y$ are called scalar components of $\overrightarrow{a}$.

## 3-D Space
Vectors in 3D space have a additional component to represent the 3thd dimension.

$$
\overrightarrow{a} = \begin{bmatrix}
1 \\
-3 \\
2 \\
\end{bmatrix}
$$

> Note: The mathamatical rules does not change by adding more dimension.

## Matrice

Rectangular bunch of numbers.

$$
A = \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 3 & -7 \\
2 & 1 & 6 \\
4 & 0 & 1 \\
\end{bmatrix}
$$

# Mappings

After data transformation (mapping), patterns become visible which have not been
visible before or notions become very easy.
