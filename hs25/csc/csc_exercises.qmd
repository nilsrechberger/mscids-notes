# Week 1: Case Study: Bits & Bytes

**Format:** `IIIIIIII.FFFF` (8 bits integer, 4 bits fraction)

**Example: `45.375`**

### 1. Integer Part (`45`)
- **Method:** Repeatedly divide by 2 & note the remainder.
- **Calculation:**
  - `45 / 2 = 22` Remainder `1`
  - `22 / 2 = 11` Remainder `0`
  - `11 / 2 = 5`  Remainder `1`
  - `5 / 2  = 2`  Remainder `1`
  - `2 / 2  = 1`  Remainder `0`
  - `1 / 2  = 0`  Remainder `1`
- **Result (read remainders from bottom to top):** `101101`
- **Pad to 8 bits (on the left):** `00101101`

### 2. Fractional Part (`0.375`)
- **Method:** Repeatedly multiply by 2 & note the integer part.
- **Calculation:**
  - `0.375 * 2 = 0.75` -> `0`
  - `0.75  * 2 = 1.5`  -> `1`
  - `0.5   * 2 = 1.0`  -> `1`
- **Result (read digits from top to bottom):** `011`
- **Pad to 4 bits (on the right):** `0110`

### 3. Combine
- **Integer:** `00101101`
- **Fraction:** `0110`
- **Final (12-Bit):** `001011010110`

#### Special Case: Loss of Precision (Ex: `2.3`)
- Not every fraction can be represented exactly.
- **Integer `2` -> `00000010`**
- **Fraction `0.3` -> `0.010011...` (repeating)**
- **Truncated to 4 bits:** `0100` (which represents `0.25`)
- **Final result for 2.3:** `000000100100` (represents `2.25`)

# Week 2: Computer Networks

## Exercise 1: Internet Delays and Routes

### a

Traceroute is a command line tool for determining the transport route of IP data packets between your own computer and a selected remote station.

```bash
traceroute gaia.cs.umass.edu
```

### b

The number of routers along the path depends on the network route and topology â€” for example, whether a VPN or proxy is used, but not on the local access medium (WiFi vs. Ethernet).

## Exercise 2: Internet Delays

### a

$$
\text{file} = 4\text{MB} = 4000\text{bytes} = 32000\text{bites}
$$

$$
R_s = 1\text{Mbit/sec} = \dfrac{32000}{1000} = 32\text{sec}
$$

## Exercise 3: Domains, Hosts and URLs

    end

    %% Subgraph trick
    subgraph row2[ ]
        direction LR
        E
        F
    end
```

## Exercise 4: http Protocol

Whenever a user downloads a new web page a copy is saved on the local web server (cache).
If the same page is requested again later by the same or another user AND it is still valid (i.e., the expiration date has not yet been
reached), the page does not have to be fetched again from the remote web server.
