# Bits

1 Byte = 8 Bits.

## Decimal to Binary Conversion

**Example: `45.375`**

### 1. Integer Part (`45`)

- **Method:** Repeatedly divide by 2 & note the remainder.
- **Calculation:**
  - `45 / 2 = 22` Remainder `1`
  - `22 / 2 = 11` Remainder `0`
  - `11 / 2 = 5`  Remainder `1`
  - `5 / 2  = 2`  Remainder `1`
  - `2 / 2  = 1`  Remainder `0`
  - `1 / 2  = 0`  Remainder `1`
- **Result (read remainders from bottom to top):** `101101`
- **Pad to 8 bits (on the left):** `00101101`

### 2. Fractional Part (`0.375`)

- **Method:** Repeatedly multiply by 2 & note the integer part.
- **Calculation:**
  - `0.375 * 2 = 0.75` -> `0`
  - `0.75  * 2 = 1.5`  -> `1`
  - `0.5   * 2 = 1.0`  -> `1`
- **Result (read digits from top to bottom):** `011`
- **Pad to 4 bits (on the right):** `0110`

### 3. Combine
- **Integer:** `00101101`
- **Fraction:** `0110`
- **Final (12-Bit):** `001011010110`

## Binary to Decimal Conversion

**Example: `11001.1101`**

### 1. Integer Part (`11001`)
- **Calculation:**
  - `1 * 2^4` -> 16
  - `1 * 2^3` -> 8
  - `0 * 2^2` -> 0
  - `0 * 2^1` -> 0
    `1 * 2^0` -> 1

**Total** = `25`

### 2. Fractional Part (`.1101`)
- **Calculation:**
  - `1 * 2^-1` -> 0.5
  - `1 * 2^-2` -> 0.25
  - `0 * 2^-3` -> 0
  - `1 * 2^-4` -> 0.0625

**Total** = 0.8125

### 3. Combine

- **Integer:** `25`
- **Fraction:** `0.8125`
- **Final (12-Bit):** `25.8125`

#### Special Case: Loss of Precision (Ex: `2.3`)

- Not every fraction can be represented exactly.
- **Integer `2` -> `00000010`**
- **Fraction `0.3` -> `0.010011...` (repeating)**
- **Truncated to 4 bits:** `0100` (which represents `0.25`)
- **Final result for 2.3:** `000000100100` (represents `2.25`)

# Bytes

- A kilobyte, or KB, is $1,024$ bytes
- A megabyte, or MB, is $1,024^2$ bytes
- A gigabyte, or GB, is $1,024^3$ bytes
- A terabyte, or TB, is $1,024^4$ bytes
- A petabyte, or PB, is $1,024^5$ bytes

# Com Net

### Key Networking Components

* **LAN:** A private, local network (e.g., home or office).
* **WAN:** A broad network connecting cities or countries (e.g., the Internet).
* **IP Address:** A unique identifier that ensures data packets reach the correct destination.
* **Router:** A gateway that connects different networks (LAN to WAN) and directs traffic between them.
* **Switch:** An intelligent hub within a LAN that learns device locations to distribute data efficiently.
* **Packet Switching:** Breaking data into small chunks (packets) and transmitting them at a specific rate ($R$).
* **Modem:** Converts signals from your ISP (e.g., fiber or cable) into a digital format your router understands.
* **Access Point (AP):** A device that creates a wireless signal (Wi-Fi) so devices can connect to the LAN without cables.
* **Firewall:** A security system that monitors and filters incoming/outgoing traffic based on predefined rules.
* **Network Interface Card (NIC):** The hardware component (in a PC or laptop) that allows a device to connect to a network.
* **DNS (Domain Name System):** The "phonebook" of the internet; it translates human-readable names (google.com) into IP addresses.


## Protocol Layers

Protocols define format, order of msgs sent and received among network entities, and actions taken on msg transmission, receipt.

- Applications: FTP, SMTP, HTTP.
- Transport: TCP, UDP.
- Network: IP, routing protocols.
- Link: Ethernet, WiFi.
- Physical: Ethernet, WiFi.

## Advantages and disadvantages of Protocol Layers

### Advantage

- Flexibility: Individual parts are replaceable.    
- Simplicity: Focus on a specific task.    
- Interoperability: All devices understand each other.

### Disadvantage

- Overhead: Data packets become larger due to multiple headers.
- Performance: “Packaging” and “unpackaging” takes time.
- Duplication: Some functions are performed multiple times.

## Domain Name System

Translates domain names to numerical IP addresses.

- DNS Recursor (Client Side): Initiates the query. It's the first stop and acts as a librarian trying to find the IP address.
- Root Nameserver (The Dot '.'): The starting point. It directs the Recursor to the correct Top-Level Domain (TLD) Nameserver.
- TLD Nameserver (e.g., .com, .de, .org): Manages all domains under its specific extension. It points the Recursor to the Authoritative Nameserver for the specific domain requested.
- Authoritative Nameserver: Holds the definitive DNS records (A, CNAME, MX, etc.) for the requested domain. It provides the actual IP address back to the Recursor.
- DNS Recursor / Client: Receives the IP address and finally connects to the web server to load the website.

## Packaet Transmission Delay

This is the time required by the transmitter to push all bits of a data packet onto the cable (or medium).

- $L$: Packet length (bits).
- $R$: Link bandwidth (dps).

$$
d_{\text{trans}} = \dfrac{L \quad \text{(bits)}}{R \quad \text{(bits/sec)}}
$$

In a network, the **slowest** point always determines the overall speed. This is known as the bottleneck principle.

$$
R_{av} = \min \{R_c, R_s, \dots, R_n\}
$$

## Propagation delay

This is the time it takes for a single bit to physically travel from point A to point B.

- $d$: Length of physical link.
- $s$: Propagation speed in medium.

$$
d_{\text{prop}} = \dfrac{d}{s}
$$

## Rate

Rate (bits/time unit) at which bits transferred between sender/receiver. We disquinsh between:

- Instantaneous: Rate at given point in time.
- Average: Rate over longer period of time.

## Delay & Loss in bash

```bash
# Trace
traceroute www.google.ch

# Total way
ping www.google.ch
```

# Visualisation

## Visual Variables

- Mark / Shape: Used shapes to distinguish between different types in a plot
- Position: Position of an object Used to encode data
- Size (Length, Area and Volume): Sizes to encode data
- Brightness: Mapping values to the plot
- Color: Colormap that can be used to encode a data variable
- Orientation: Used to encode data
- Texture: Mapping values to the plot
- Motion: Associated with any of the other visual variables

# Recursion Essentials

Recursion involves a function calling itself to solve a smaller sub-problem.

## 3-Step Pattern
1. **Base Case:** The exit condition to stop recursion (prevents Stack Overflow).
2. **Recursive Step:** The function calls itself with reduced input.
3. **Convergence:** Ensure the input always moves toward the Base Case.

## Code Example (Python)

```python
def factorial(n):
    if n <= 1: return 1     # 1. Base Case
    return n * factorial(n - 1) # 2. Recursive Step
```

# Cloud Comp

## Hardware Essentials

### Central Processing Unit (CPU)
The CPU is the "brain" of the computer, processing commands via the **Instruction Cycle**:
* **Fetch**: Retrieves an instruction from the RAM.
* **Decode**: Translates the instruction into internal signals.
* **Execute**: Carries out the operation and stores the result.

### Random Access Memory (RAM)
* **Function**: High-speed storage for data and instructions currently in use by the CPU.
* **Property**: **Volatile**—all data is lost when the power is turned off.

## Cloud Computing Fundamentals

### Business Model
* **Client**: Pays based on actual usage rather than provisioning for peak capacity.
* **Provider**: Leverages shared capabilities to serve multiple users efficiently.

### Core Cloud Properties
* **Self-managing Services**: Consumers can provision resources automatically as needed without requiring human interaction with the provider.
* **High Accessibility**: Resources are available over the network anytime and from any location.

# Virtualization

Virtualization is essentially a way to trick a computer into thinking it is running multiple separate machines, all on the same physical hardware. The piece of software that makes this possible is called a Hypervisor.

## Virtualization: Hypervisors

A Hypervisor is software that creates and runs virtual machines.

* **Type 1 (Bare-Metal)**:
    * **Setup**: Installed directly on the physical hardware.
    * **Pros**: High performance, efficient, and secure due to direct hardware access.
    * **Usage**: Enterprise servers and data centers (e.g., VMware ESXi).
* **Type 2 (Hosted)**:
    * **Setup**: Runs as an application on top of an existing Operating System (Windows/macOS).
    * **Pros**: Easy to set up for development and testing.
    * **Usage**: Personal computers (e.g., VirtualBox).

    ### Virtualization: Pros & Cons

## Advantages
* **Efficiency**: Maximizes hardware use by running multiple VMs on one physical server.
* **Cost Savings**: Lowers expenses for hardware, power, and cooling.
* **Isolation**: Enhances security; a compromised VM does not affect others on the same host.
* **Disaster Recovery**: Enables instant movement or restoration of entire VMs.

## Disadvantages
* **Single Point of Failure**: If the physical host fails, all hosted VMs crash.
* **Performance Overhead**: The hypervisor consumes resources, causing a slight speed loss.
* **Complexity**: Requires specialized expertise and software to manage.
* **Resource Contention**: Multiple VMs competing for the same CPU/RAM can cause bottlenecks.

# Processing Data

## `grep`

Take a stream of text or data, perform operations on it, and produce a modified version of that stream as output.

```bash
grep -e <REGEX_PATTERN> <FILE>
```

## `cut`

Selects portions of each line (as specified by list) from each file and writes them to the output.

```bash
cut -d <DELIMITER> -f <FIELD_SELECTION> <FILE>
```

## `wget`

Wget is a free utility for non-interactive download of files and whole websites (follows links) from the Internet.

## Pipes & Filters Pattern

A pipe is used in Linux to send the output of one command/process to another command/process for further processing. Decompose a task that performs complex processing into a series of separate processing steps that can be reused.

```bash
grep -e <REGEX_PATTERN> <FILE> | cut -d <DELIMITER> -f <FIELD_SELECTION> <FILE>
```

## 5V-Model

The 5 V's of big data are Volume, Velocity, Variety, Veracity, and Value. These characteristics help define the challenges and opportunities associated with managing and analyzing large data sets.

## Regular Expressions

A regular expression, often shortened to regex, is a sequence of characters that defines a search pattern. It uses a specific syntax combining literal characters (e.g., a, 1) and metacharacters (e.g., . , *, []) which have special meaning.
