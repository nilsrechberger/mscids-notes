# Introduction

## How can Data Science improve Products & Services?

Data Science improves traditional productio nwith basic function by Digital services using Data Science driven functions. The result is a new poroduct type, for Example watch vs. smart watch.
To do so, data has to be processec, visialized, tranferd storaged and used in a program.

# Computer Network

## Fundaments of Computer Networks

A computer network is build of several components:

- Coneccted devises: Hosts (end stystems).
- Communications linsk: Wired and wireless.
- Protocols: Sending and receiving data.
- Packet switches: routers and switches.

### Example Net

## Packet Switching

The Host dates applicatins messages and breaks them into smaller chunks (aka. packets) of length $L$ bits. The packets are transmitted into access network at rate $R$, called link capacity/bandwith.

### Packaet Transmission Delay

- $L$: Packet lenght (bits).
- $R$: Link bandwith (dps).

$$
d_{\text{trans}} = \dfrac{L \quad \text{(bits)}}{R \quad \text{(bits/sec)}}
$$

### Propagation delay

- $d$: Length of physical link.
- $s$: Propagation speed in medium.

$$
d_{\text{prop}} = \dfrac{d}{s}
$$

### Rate

Rate (bits/time unit) at which bits transferred between sender/receiver. We disquinsh between:

- Instantaneous: Rate at given point in time.
- Average: Rate over longer period of time.

## Protocol Layers

Protocols define format, order of msgs sent and received among network entities, and actions taken on msg transmission, receipt.

- Applications: FTP, SMTP, HTTP.
- Transport: TCP, UDP.
- Network: IP, routing protocols.
- Link: Ethernet, WiFi.
- Physical: Ethernet, WiFi.

## Addressing in Computer Networks

### Domain Name System

Translates domain names to numerical IP addresses.

- DNS Recursor (Client Side): Initiates the query. It's the first stop and acts as a librarian trying to find the IP address.
- Root Nameserver (The Dot '.'): The starting point. It directs the Recursor to the correct Top-Level Domain (TLD) Nameserver.
- TLD Nameserver (e.g., .com, .de, .org): Manages all domains under its specific extension. It points the Recursor to the Authoritative Nameserver for the specific domain requested.
- Authoritative Nameserver: Holds the definitive DNS records (A, CNAME, MX, etc.) for the requested domain. It provides the actual IP address back to the Recursor.
- DNS Recursor / Client: Receives the IP address and finally connects to the web server to load the website.

### IP Addressing

Each device is assigned a unique IP address build up by `Net ID` + `Host ID`

## Switch

A network switch is a central component in almost every wired network, especially in local area networks (LANs). It acts as an intelligent distribution station for data traffic. Based on incoming frames
switch “learns” location of sender. Records sender/location pair in switch table.

## Router

A router is a network device that forwards data packets between different networks. It ensures that information (e.g. a website, video or email) reaches the recipient from the sender – even if it has to pass through many intermediate stations.
