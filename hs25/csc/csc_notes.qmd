# Introduction

## How can Data Science improve Products & Services?

Data Science improves traditional productio nwith basic function by Digital services using Data Science driven functions. The result is a new poroduct type, for Example watch vs. smart watch.
To do so, data has to be processec, visialized, tranferd storaged and used in a program.

# Computer Network

## Fundaments of Computer Networks

A computer network is build of several components:

- Coneccted devises: Hosts (end stystems).
- Communications linsk: Wired and wireless.
- Protocols: Sending and receiving data.
- Packet switches: routers and switches.

### Example Net

## Packet Switching

The Host dates applicatins messages and breaks them into smaller chunks (aka. packets) of length $L$ bits. The packets are transmitted into access network at rate $R$, called link capacity/bandwith.

### Packaet Transmission Delay

- $L$: Packet lenght (bits).
- $R$: Link bandwith (dps).

$$
d_{\text{trans}} = \dfrac{L \quad \text{(bits)}}{R \quad \text{(bits/sec)}}
$$

### Propagation delay

- $d$: Length of physical link.
- $s$: Propagation speed in medium.

$$
d_{\text{prop}} = \dfrac{d}{s}
$$

### Rate

Rate (bits/time unit) at which bits transferred between sender/receiver. We disquinsh between:

- Instantaneous: Rate at given point in time.
- Average: Rate over longer period of time.

## Protocol Layers

Protocols define format, order of msgs sent and received among network entities, and actions taken on msg transmission, receipt.

- Applications: FTP, SMTP, HTTP.
- Transport: TCP, UDP.
- Network: IP, routing protocols.
- Link: Ethernet, WiFi.
- Physical: Ethernet, WiFi.

## Addressing in Computer Networks

### Domain Name System

Translates domain names to numerical IP addresses.

- DNS Recursor (Client Side): Initiates the query. It's the first stop and acts as a librarian trying to find the IP address.
- Root Nameserver (The Dot '.'): The starting point. It directs the Recursor to the correct Top-Level Domain (TLD) Nameserver.
- TLD Nameserver (e.g., .com, .de, .org): Manages all domains under its specific extension. It points the Recursor to the Authoritative Nameserver for the specific domain requested.
- Authoritative Nameserver: Holds the definitive DNS records (A, CNAME, MX, etc.) for the requested domain. It provides the actual IP address back to the Recursor.
- DNS Recursor / Client: Receives the IP address and finally connects to the web server to load the website.

### IP Addressing

Each device is assigned a unique IP address build up by `Net ID` + `Host ID`

## Switch

A network switch is a central component in almost every wired network, especially in local area networks (LANs). It acts as an intelligent distribution station for data traffic. Based on incoming frames
switch “learns” location of sender. Records sender/location pair in switch table.

> Note: Layer 2 – Data Link Layer

## Router

A router is a network device that forwards data packets between different networks. It ensures that information (e.g. a website, video or email) reaches the recipient from the sender – even if it has to pass through many intermediate stations.

# Week 3: Case Study – Web Applications & HTML

## Client Server Communication Pattern

Clients (e.g. Browser) send service requests. Servers (e.g. Web, Database) wait for requests to arrive from clients and then respond to. Client receive service responses from centralized server.

## Uniform Resource Locator (URL)

Reference to a web resource that specifies its location in a computer network (e.g. web page, video, image, etc.)

## HTML

Descriptive Language HTML, with a set of HTML elements/tags, is used to create Websites and publish content on the Internet in a simple and standardized way. The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) ensures that content on a Web server can be accessed and interpreted by a Web client and thus displayed within a browser.

### Elements & Tags

Most HTML Elements are characterized by having a start and end tag.

```{html}
<h1>Header 1</h1>
<p>Paragraph</p> 
```

- Headings: Headings are text size pre-sets ranging from `<h1>` to `<h6>`
- Paragraphs: Paragraphs are used to create text blocks with `<p>content</p>`
- Bold: With `<b> text </b>` text can be set to bold.
- Italic: With `<i> text </i>` text can be set to italic.
- Underline: With `<u> text </u>` text can be underlined.
- Hyperlinks: Using the anchor tag with an link as attribute: `<a href="Reference target"> Text </a>`
- Images: Image tag with at least a source attribute: `<img src = "path/file" >`

#### Nested Elements

It is possible to include elements within elements. Such constructs are being referred to as nested elements.

```{html}
<p>Star<b>Wars</b></p>
```

#### Structural Elements

The structural elements can be considered as the core setup of any HTML
Website.

- `<!DOCTYPE html>`: Declares using HTML5
- `<html> </html>`: Defines the root of an HTML document
- `<head> </head>`: Meta data about the HTML document
- `<body> </body>`: All content of the HTML document

## CSS

CSS is a stylesheet language that is primarily used to describe the appearance and formatting of a document written in a markup language such as HTML.

## Low Code Environments

Combines visual program elements like variables, loops or conditional statements rather than specifying them textually.
