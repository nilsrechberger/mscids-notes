# Datatypes and Variables

## Exercises 1

### What does Python return as result of the following calculations?

```{python}
print(f"10 + 10 + 10 = {10 + 10 + 10}")
print(f"10 - 3       = {10 - 3}")
print(f"10 * 2       = {10 * 2}")
print(f"5 / 2        = {5 / 2}")
print(f"5.0 / 2      = {5.0 / 2}")
print(f"5 % 2        = {5 % 2}")
print(f"10 % 3       = {10 % 3}")
print(f"3 ** 3       = {3 ** 3}")
print(f"9 ** 0.5     = {9 ** 0.5}")
print(f"10 + 3 * 3   = {10 + 3 * 3}")
print(f"(10 + 3) * 3 = {(10 + 3) * 3}")

```

### Try to find out: What happens?

```{python}
a = 23
b = 23
print(f"a = {a}")
print(f"The ID of a is {id(a)}") # Prints memory address of the variable a
print(f"a is of type {type(a)}") # Prints the data type of the variable a
```

> Note: `id()` corresponds to the objects memory address during its lifetime.

```{python}
print(f"b = {b}")
print(f"The ID of b is {id(b)}")
print(f"b is of type {type(a)}")
```

### Change the value of variable "a"

```{python}
a = 123 # Reassign a to int 123
print(f"a = {a}")
print(f"The ID of a is {id(a)}")
print(f"a is of type {type(a)}")
```

### What happens now? why?

```{python}
c = 23
print(f"c = {c}")
print(f"The ID of a is {id(c)}")
print(f"c is of type {type(c)}")
```

We reference the variable `c` to the value `23` and check its data type and memory location.

### Try the same thing with a float variable!!!

```{python}
d = 3.142
print(f"d = {d}")
print(f"The ID of a is {id(d)}")
print(f"d is of type {type(d)}")
```

### Printing of text (strings)

```{python}
print ("HSLU's Python course is cool")

print("This is Line 1")
print("This is Line 2")

print("\nWhat does the \\n control character do? Are you sure?") # \n is a line break

print("\tWhat does the \\t control character do? Are you sure?") # \t is a tabulator

print("I want to learn python because....")
print("\n\n\t....it's a cool data science programming language. Ok - there are also others ;-) !")

print("What " + "is " + "wrong?" + "\nAdd some space between the words without removing the '+' signs!")
```

### try to understand the behaviour

```{python}
g=h='hslu'      # Assign the variables g and h to the string "hslu"
print(g)        # prints hslu
print(h)        # print hslu
h=456           # Reassign h to int 456
print(h)        # prints 456
h=h+1           # Calculates 456 + 1 = 457
print(h)        # prints 457
h+=1            # Calculates 457 + 1 = 458
print(h)        # prints 458
p='hslu'        # Assign the variable p to the string "hslu"
q=p             # Copies the variable p (hlsu) to the variable q
print(p==q)     # Compare the variables p and q (Output: True)
print(p is q)   # Compare the variables p and q (Output: True)
```
